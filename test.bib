Abstract = {Due to recent technological advances, organizations currently face massive changes of their work design and leadership. Unfortunately, the exact nature of these changes is still unclear as most existing studies were conducted during earlier stages of the digital transformation and the available literature is highly fragmented. To provide an up-to-date overview on the changes in work design and leadership resulting from the digital transformation and to structure our existing knowledge in this domain, we conducted an open-ended online survey with 49 recognized digitalization experts and identified key themes of change. In sum, four key themes of change affecting both work design and leadership emerged, namely changes in work-life and health, the use of information and communication technology, performance and talent management and organizational hierarchies. In addition, two macro-level change dimensions regarding the structure of work and relationshiporiented leadership evolved. While)},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the factors influencing satisfaction on blended learning among undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach: This type of study is correlational analysis with the questionnaire distributed to the 476 undergraduates. Convenience sampling techniques is used in this study. Findings: Perceived ease of use, perceived value, learning climate and student-instructor interaction are having significant impact towards blended learning satisfaction among undergraduates. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to two higher learning institution that might have different result compared to the study conducted for all higher learning institution in Malaysia. Practical implications: The higher learning institution will be able to determine the blended learning satisfaction level among undergraduates. Originality/value: Providing more literature on blended learning study in Malaysia. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyright of Global Busi)},
